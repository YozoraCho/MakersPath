# Maker’s Path

**A profession-driven crafting companion for World of Warcraft: Classic Era.**  
Track, compare, and plan your craftable gear upgrades. Maker’s Path helps Classic Era players master their professions with tailored upgrade suggestions and a built-in profession book.

## Overview

**Maker’s Path** was designed with the *Crafted-Locked Challenge* in mind, but it’s equally useful for anyone who enjoys self-sufficient play.  
It scans your learned professions, indexes all craftable gear, and builds a personalized list of items you can make yourself.  
No dungeon drops, no world loot clutter — just pure craftsmanship.
